## Introduction

Welcome to the Odin Recipes project! This project is part of The Odin Project's curriculum, aimed at helping you practice basic HTML structure and linking between multiple pages. By the end of this project, you will have created a small recipe website with multiple pages linked together.

### Project Overview

In this project, I will be building a simple recipe website. The main page will serve as an index of recipes, and each recipe will have its own dedicated page with details such as an image, description, ingredients, and steps.

### Skills Demonstrated

Upon completing this project, I will have demonstrated proficiency in the following areas:

1. **HTML Structure**: Creating well-structured HTML documents with proper tags and hierarchy.
2. **Linking Between Pages**: Using anchor tags to link between different HTML pages within the same project.
3. **Using Lists**: Implementing both ordered and unordered lists to organize content on a webpage.
4. **Embedding Images**: Including images within HTML documents to enhance the visual appeal of the page.
5. **Basic Web Design**: Applying basic principles of web design to create a clean and navigable site structure.
